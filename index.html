    <p class="content">
      
        You know…
Some nights don’t feel like nights.
They feel like a pause button on life.
Where time slows down.
The wind hums your secrets.
And the moon… becomes your silent witness.

15th September. Saharanpur. Mirzapur town. Sakshi Rana’s birthday.

I still remember every frame.
The narrow streets of Mirzapur, decorated with string lights like tiny fallen stars.
The sweet, thick smell of gulab jamuns coming from the kitchen.
And the faint sound of an old transistor playing…
“Pal pal dil ke paas…”

And then… her house.
Simple.
Warm.
Alive.

There were balloons stuck to the walls, some half deflated already.
A small, unevenly cut Happy Birthday Sakshi banner hung crookedly on the gate.
But inside… it felt like magic.


---

I wasn’t even supposed to be there.
I’m not a party person.
But Anshul dragged me along.

“Chal na bhai. Poora gang jaa raha hai. Tere bina maza nahi aayega.”

Truth was…
I wanted to go.
Because she would be there.

Sakshi.

I saw her for the first time two years ago in C class.
The lecturer made a silly mistake.
Everyone noticed.
No one spoke.

Except her.

“Sir, ye logic galat hai. Compile nahi hoga aise.”

And the class laughed.
She didn’t care.
There was this fierce honesty in her eyes.
The kind of girl jo daant bhi khayegi… lekin jo sahi hai, wo kahegi.

That day… something inside me shifted.
I didn’t even realize it then.
But over the months…
She became my favorite distraction.


---

In canteen queues.
While adjusting my bike’s rear-view mirror just to see her pass by.
Those little accidental encounters in the library aisle.
And that one time during the power cut in lab…
Our eyes met in the dark for a second longer than usual.

But I never spoke.

Coward, huh?

“Kuch cheezein sirf dekhne ke liye hoti hain… paane ke liye nahi,” I told myself.


---

And then… that night happened.

The terrace was the prettiest place I’d seen in a while.
Fairy lights zigzagged above us like constellations.
A cheap Bluetooth speaker blasted old Bollywood numbers.
And the moon hung so low… it felt like even it came to watch her smile.

Everyone was there.
Palak Saini, laughing loudly as always.
Priyaa Rana, with that shy smile.
Vikash, stealing glances at Priyaa.
Ranjan, holding a dairy milk he was too scared to give Palak.
Anshul, fumbling with his phone, trying to get a selfie with Priya Saini.

And then… there was me.
In one corner of the terrace, hiding behind a glass of coke, counting how many times her bangles jingled when she moved.

She looked…
No, she felt like a poem you never wanted to finish.

A peach colored kurti.
Hair loosely tied, strands falling over her cheek.
A tiny black bindi above those sharp eyes.
And that laugh…
That laugh that could melt winters.

It wasn’t perfect.
It wasn’t a big party.
There were no expensive dresses or DJ nights.

It was raw.
It was real.
And in that imperfect little world… she was the most perfect thing.


---

I carried something that night.
A diary.

An old brown diary I’d scribbled in for months.
Moments, words, little confessions.
A list of every time she smiled.
A stupid tally of how many times I saw her in a week.

I never meant to show it.
It was my secret universe.

But you know how some nights whisper in your ears —
“Ab bol de.”

This was that night.


---

As the cake was cut, and everyone sang off-tune…
I stood silently, watching.
The way she closed her eyes while making a wish.
The way she laughed when Vikash accidentally smeared cake on his own face.
The way she saved the biggest piece for Priyaa.

And then…
As the party moved to the terrace again…
And everyone chased each other with water bottles…
She walked towards me.

“Adi… yaha kya kar raha hai? Sab upar mast dance kar rahe hain… tu corner mein khada hai.”

Her voice.
Soft.
Unfiltered.

I looked at her.
Straight, for the first time in years.
And my heart did this stupid somersault inside my chest.

No dramatic build-up.
No background music in real life.
But in my head…
Everything slowed down.

I held out the diary.
My hands shaking.
Heart pounding louder than the speaker behind me.

She looked confused.
Took it.

Opened the first page.

And there it was.

“Pehli baar tujhe dekh ke laga tha ki programming se zyada logical cheez bhi zindagi mein ho sakti hai… tu.”

She read.
And smiled.

Not the teasing, mocking Sakshi Rana smile.
A soft, almost shy one.

And then she said,
“Late bol diya Prajapati. Mujhe bhi tab se bas tu hi achha lagta tha.”

I swear…
In that moment… the wind felt warmer.
The stars blinked brighter.
And the moon winked.

Us raat chand bhi humare pyaar ka gawaah bana.


---

Everyone else was busy teasing.
Vikash finally gave Priyaa the roses he’d hidden.
Ranjan passed Palak the dairy milk.
Anshul nervously told Priya Saini she looked pretty.

And me?

I held her hand.
And together… we stood quietly under that sky.

Two hearts.
No words needed.
No promises made.
Just… home.

That night wasn’t about grand gestures.
It was about small things.

A look.
A line in a diary.
A smile.
And a hand held under fairy lights.

Some love stories don’t need an ending.
Bas ek raat chahiye hoti hai, jahan waqt ruk jaaye… aur zindagi apna naya chapter likh de.

That was my night.
That was our story.

And Saharanpur still knows… us raat chand bhi hume dekh kar muskara raha tha.</p>
